# A Spotify-Pitchfork integrated recommendation engine

## In this project, I create a reviewer recommendation engine to match individual consumers with compatible music critics.

**Background:** Music preferences are highly variable across individuals, genres, etc. Despite this variability, an overwhelming number of new artists and albums are released each year and as a result our process of discovering new favorites can rely heavily on a few reviewers and “best-of” lists. With disproportionate influence on artist popularity, an important question is whether major music review sites such as Pitchfork (“The Most Trusted Voice in Music”) are “unbiased” in their reviews. 

Namely, do they display favorable (or unfavorable) bias towards certain characteristics present in music, and can these characteristics be used to profile different types of reviewers? Perhaps, whether reviewers are “unbiased” is not even the right question to ask. Matching reviewer bias with consumer preference could provide more accurate music recommendations, a domain that streaming services such as Spotify already pose a threat in as they constantly improve algorithms that automatically accomplish this task.
 
**Project:** In this project, I categorize reviewers by preference towards music characteristics and genre to predict what ratings they will score. I then produce a proof-of-concept recommendation engine that can match an individual to a reviewer or cluster of reviewers on Pitchfork, based on similiar music tastes.
